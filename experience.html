					<h4>
					July 2024 - Present
					</h4>
					<p>
					As a Headstarter AI Fellow, I will be building 5 AI projects in 5 weeks, and as a final deliverable, I will aim to take a startupâ€™s current backlog and build it meeting business requirements.
					The part I am most excited about this fellowship is that I will be able to build my technical and collaborative skills!

					</h4>
					<p>
					In my summers, I volunteered 160 hours over 4 weeks to teach, assist, and guide students from ages 5-12 through the world of tech, science, and programming. By teaching skills such as 
					foundational programming, basic robotics, website creation and more I was able to deepen my passion and understanding of those subjects!

					<h4>
					September 2023 - January 2024
					</h4>
					<p>
					As a Computer Science 11/12 Teaching Assistant, I supported and helped Grade 11 and 12 students as they learned the basics of Java, Python, and PHP. Through lessons, answering questions,
					and discussing with students I grew to gain a deeper understanding of the languages as a whole!

					<p>
					As a Peer Tutor, I supported my fellow peers by tutoring them in a variety of subjects such as Math, English, Physics, and Science for over 60 hours through after-school and lunchtime 
					sessions. It helped me build communication and teaching skills which encouraging me to pursue other similar opportunities due to the joy teaching others gave me.
